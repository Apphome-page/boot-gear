          ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE
        </h3>
        <p>
          Following registration, you can review and change the information you
          submitted at the stage of registration, except Email ID and mobile
          number. An option for facilitating such change shall be present on the
          Platform and such change shall be facilitated by the User. If you
          change any information, we may or may not keep track of your old
          information. We will not retain in our files information you have
          requested to remove for certain circumstances, such as to resolve
          disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and conditions.
          Such prior information shall be completely removed from our databases,
          including stored &quot;back up&quot; systems. If you believe that any
          information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, or to
          remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the User needs to
          remediate, and promptly correct any such incorrect information.
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-5 mb-1'>CONTROL OF YOUR PASSWORD</h3>
        <p>
          You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
          your password. It is important that you protect it against
          unauthorized access of your account and information by choosing your
          password carefully and keeping your password and computer secure by
          signing out after using our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password
          of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any
          third party. You are responsible for all actions taken with your login
          information and password, including fees. If you lose control of your
          password, you may lose substantial control over your personally
          identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions
          taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised
          for any reason, you should immediately change your password. You agree
          to notify us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized
          use of your account or access to your password even after changing it.
        </p>
        <h3 className='mt-5 mb-1'>SECURITY</h3>
        <p>
          We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
          unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to
          protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and
          outside the Firm. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
          protect the Personal Information submitted to us and information that
          we have accessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system
          is impenetrable. Our Firm cannot guarantee the security of our
          database, nor can we guarantee that information you provide won&quot;t
          be intercepted while being transmitted to the Firm over the Internet.
